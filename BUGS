What works:
- Standardizer (Partial and Full)
- Control Structure generation

What doesn't:
- Environment lookup (partially implemented)
- The primative environment (partially implemented)
- Recursion
- The extended CSE machine (only simple is implemented)

Unfortunately it's impossible to see the whole thing in action. It fails on
every test case. You can however run the standardizer and control-structure
generator separately with `-st` (partial standardizer), `-fst` (full
standardizer), and `-control` (control structures, assumes UTF-8 terminal).

Hopefully I can at least be graded on what works...
