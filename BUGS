What works:
- Standardizer (Partial and Full)
- Control Structure generation
- The entire primitive environment (as far as I can tell)
- Environment lookup (as far as I can tell)

What doesn't:
- Recursion
- Passing lambdas as arguments to other lambdas
  (it's a tricky type issue with Haskell)

The program fails on all but 15 of the test cases. You can run the standardizer
and control-structure generator separately with `-st` (partial standardizer),
`-fst` (full standardizer), and `-control` (control structures, assumes UTF-8
terminal).
